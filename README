Compile all your .jave files(in different folders!) into .class files in a seperate directory!!!

how to use:

  copy&paste por.bat under your java project folder
  double click the file and ...
  that's it! you can find your compilations under .\bin
  
  or, you can add por to your environment path and run using the keyword "por"...under your project directory
  
it can also run your main class conveniently;
  just type:
    por your_package_name_+_main_class_name
  for example
    por com.git.Main
  "com.git"is the package that Main.class is in
